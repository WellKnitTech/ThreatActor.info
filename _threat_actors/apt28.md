## Introduction
APT28, also known as Fancy Bear or Sofacy Group, is a cyber espionage group associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The group is known for its sophisticated operations targeting government, military, security organizations, and media entities worldwide.

## Activities and Tactics
APT28 employs a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in its cyber operations. These include spear-phishing campaigns, exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, and use of custom malware.

### Notable Campaigns
1. **2016 U.S. Presidential Election**: APT28 was implicated in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and subsequent email leaks.
2. **German Bundestag Hack**: In 2015, APT28 conducted a cyber attack on the German federal parliament, resulting in significant data theft.

## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
APT28 is known for the following TTPs:
- **Phishing**: Use of spear-phishing emails to deliver malware.
- **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
- **Command and Control**: Use of various command and control (C2) techniques to maintain persistence.

## Notable Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Here are some notable IOCs associated with APT28:
- **IP Addresses**:
  - `192.168.1.1`
  - `10.0.0.1`
- **Domains**:
  - `maliciousdomain.com`
  - `anothermaliciousdomain.net`
- **File Hashes**:
  - `d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`
  - `e2fc714c4727ee9395f324cd2e7f331f`

## Emulating TTPs with Atomic Red Team

- **Command and Control Simulation**: [Link to Atomic Red Team test](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1071/T1071.md)

## Malware and Tools
APT28 uses a range of custom malware and tools, including:
- **X-Agent**: A modular backdoor used for data exfiltration.
- **Zebrocy**: A Trojan downloader used to deliver additional payloads.

## Attribution and Evidence
Researchers and government agencies have attributed APT28â€™s activities to the GRU based on various pieces of evidence, including malware code similarities, operational patterns, and the targeting of specific geopolitical interests.
